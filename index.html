<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
<p>Genesis is a multicreator gaming universe, with a diverse community working together to achieve a common goal: A
  metaverse that will still be growing, evolving, and actively played in 100 years.</p>
<p>To achieve this, development and management of Genesis will be decentralized, with governance decisions guided by the
  Genesis Foundation, and voted on by players using the GENESIS token. Genesis will run as a nonprofit, with all assets
  owned by and revenue earned by the Genesis Foundation reinvested in the long-term success of the game.</p>
<p>The <a href={{"vision"|relative_url}}>Vision section</a> contains an overview of Genesis, including its culture,
  community, governance, tokenomics, and roadmap.</p>

<h2 id="community">Community & Governance</h2>
<p>Genesis is community-developed and community-goverened. The <a href={{"governance"|relative_url}}>Governance
    section</a> lays out the Genesis governance processes and procedures, and the <a
    href={{"cips"|relative_url}}>Community Improvement Proposals (CIPs) section</a> contains all current and past
  community proposals.</p>
<p>You can also find important documents such as community guidelines and terms of service in the <a
    href={{"resources"|relative_url}}>Resources section</a>.</p>
