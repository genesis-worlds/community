<h2>Inclusion</h2>
<p>The third pillar of Genesis culture is inclusion - a broad base of diverse members will create a more vibrant and exciting community. Genesis needs a constant influx of new community members, who believe in the Genesis vision, and take on progressively more responsibility. Weâ€™re all responsible for recruiting new community members, and ensuring that they know their way around, know the culture, and get involved.</p>
