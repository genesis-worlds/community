<p>Building a strong culture for Genesis and its community is our #1 goal. If we get this right, everything else falls into place. Firstly, we’re building for the long term. Most companies don’t think 10 years into the future - we’re looking 10 times that far. That changes where you focus. Culture and community become incredibly important elements, to maintain continuity across 5 generations.</p>
<p>Secondly, you're the hero of this story. There’s no time where you’ll have more impact on Genesis than right now. While we’re growing, everything is fair game - you can get involved and make real differences to gameplay, metaverse features, IP, nfts, collectibles, and more. So, when we use the word "we", we're talking about you, and everyone in the community that you're now a part of.</p>
<p>The three pillars of Genesis culture are <b>Creativity</b>, <b>Collaboration</b>, and <b>Inclusion</b>. Each is equally important to building a lasting game.</p>
