<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>The second pillar is collaboration. The Genesis community is not an “every person for themselves” group. It’s a community of diverse individuals working together to achieve a common goal. Genesis will succeed when we encourage and incentivize groups to form, grow, and work on projects together. We’ll help community members find groups and teams that can utilize their talents. And we’ll watch each other’s backs. If we see issues that affect other peoples’ experiences, we’ll help them overcome those issues, and help the wider community prevent those issues in the future.</p>
