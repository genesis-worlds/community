<h2 id="risks">5. Representations and Risks</h2>
<h3>5.1 Disclaimer</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that your use of Genesis is at your sole risk. Genesis are provided on an "AS IS" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. You acknowledge and agree that the Foundation has no control over, and no duty to take any action regarding: which users gain access to or use Genesis; what effects Genesis may have on you; the tokens, Worlds and Land you own; how you may interpret or use Genesis; or what actions you may take or fail to take as a result of having been exposed to Genesis. You release the Foundation from all liability for your inability to access to Genesis or any Content therein. The Foundation is not and cannot be responsible for and makes no representations, warranties or covenants concerning any content contained in or accessed through Genesis, and the Foundation will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed through Genesis.</p>

<h3>5.2 Sophistication and Risk of Cryptographic Systems</h3>
<p>By utilizing Genesis or interacting with Genesis or platform or anything contained or provided therein in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems; and warrant that you have an understanding of the usage, risks, potential bugs based on novel technology (where applicable), and intricacies of native cryptographic tokens, like Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), smart contract based tokens such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20), World (the ERC-1155 token associated with each world) GENESIS (the ERC-20 token that allows users to claim parcels of Land and trade with each other within Genesis), Land (the ERC-721 token, associating each Land parcel's x and y coordinates with a definition of a parcel's 3D scene that makes up the larger metaverse) and blockchain-based software systems.</p>

<h3>5.3 Risk of Regulatory Actions in One or More Jurisdictions</h3>
<p>The Foundation, GENESIS, Worlds, Land, Matic, and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action, which could impede or limit your ability to access or use Genesis or Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<h3>5.4 Risk of Weaknesses or Exploits in the Field of Cryptography</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that cryptography is a progressing field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers may present risks to smart contracts, cryptocurrencies and Genesis, which could result in the theft or loss of your cryptographic tokens or property, among other potential consequences. To the extent possible, the Foundation intends to undertake reasonable measures to update the protocol underlying Genesis to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures that the Foundation should become aware of, but the Foundation does not guarantee or otherwise represent that the Foundation can provide security for the system. By using Genesis you acknowledge and agree to undertake these risks.</p>

<h3>5.5 Volatility of Crypto Assets</h3>
<p>Some portions of Genesis allow the use of GENESIS, ETH, MATIC or other similar blockchain technologies. You acknowledge and agree that GENESIS, Ether, Matic and blockchain technologies and associated assets, and other assets are highly volatile due to many factors including but not limited to popularity, adoption, speculation, regulation, technology and security risks. You also acknowledge and agree that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain. The Foundation does not invite or make any offer to acquire, purchase, sell, transfer or otherwise deal in any crypto asset. Third parties may provide services involving the acquisition, purchase, sale, transfer or exchange of crypto-assets; the Foundation does not provide any such service and does not undertake any liability in connection thereto. You acknowledge and agree these risks and represent that the Foundation cannot be held liable for changes and fluctuations in value or increased costs.</p>

<p>There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections failure or problems, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that the Foundation will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network or any sidechain or similar device for processing transactions, however caused.</p>

<h3>5.6 Application Security</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Genesis and related applications are software code and are subject to flaws and acknowledge that you are solely responsible for evaluating any smart contract, code provided by Genesis or Content and the trustworthiness of any third-party websites, products, smart-contracts, or Content you access or use through Genesis. You further expressly acknowledge and agree that Ethereum applications can be written maliciously or negligently, that the Foundation cannot be held liable for your interaction with such applications and that such applications may cause the loss of property or even identity. This warning and others later provided by the Foundation in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing Genesis.</p>

<h3>5.7 Third Party Providers</h3>
<p>The Foundation neither owns nor controls MetaMask, Ledger Wallet, the Mist browser, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, the Polygon network, any Web3 Provider or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of Genesis. The Foundation shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor shall the Foundation be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.</p>

<h3>5.8 Taxes</h3>
<p>You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your World token, GENESIS token, or Land parcel related transactions, and any other transaction conducted by you. The Foundation does not, and will not, have any insight into or control over any transactions conducted by you in Genesis, and thus is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions entered through Genesis or otherwise involving any World token, GENESIS token, or Land parcel, or any other related transaction, and is not to act as a withholding tax agent in any circumstances whatsoever.</p>

<h3>5.9 Uses of Genesis</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Genesis does not store, send, or receive World tokens, GENESIS tokens, or Land parcel tokens. This is because tokens exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on Genesis's supporting blockchain in the Ethereum and Polygon networks. Any transfer of World tokens, GENESIS tokens, or Land parcels occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not within Genesis.</p>

<h3>5.10 Risks of Changes to Platforms</h3>
<p>Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, Polygon to the Polygon platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum or Polygon platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum or Polygon platforms may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, ERC-721 standard, or any other future Ethereum standard.</p>

<h2 id="fees">6. Transactions and Fees</h2>
<h3>6.1 Transactions on Third-Party Networks</h3>
<p>If you elect to purchase, trade, or sell a World, Land parcel, Avatar, wearable or other non-fungible token (“NFT”) with or from other users via Genesis, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network, Polygon network or other sidechains via Web3 providers. The Foundation will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, the Foundation will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via Genesis, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network, and other networks, sidechains or Web3 providers.</p>

<h3>6.2 Transaction Fees</h3>
<p></p>Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a " Gas Fee") for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via Genesis. You accept that the payment of the Gas Fee is inherent to the nature of the Ethereum network and alien to the Foundation or due to the use of Genesis.

<h3>6.3 Transaction Costs</h3>
<p>Transactions taking place in the World sale will derive in a 10% GAME fee (the "World Sale Transaction Cost") calculated over the amount of GAME involved in such transactions. Such World Sale Transaction Cost will be borne by the participants to the transaction. </p>

<h3>6.4 Personal Responsibility</h3>
<p>You will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes that may apply on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, "Taxes") associated with your use of Genesis (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, or transfer of any NFT and any activity conducted by you in Genesis). Except for income taxes levied on the Foundation, you: 
<ol>
  <li>will pay or reimburse the Foundation for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and </li>
  <li>shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to the Foundation pursuant to these Terms.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="changes">7. Changes</h2>
<p>The Foundation may make changes to the Terms from time to time. When the Foundation makes changes, the updated Terms will be made available through a website within Genesis and update the "Last Updated" date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of Genesis after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you must not access or use Genesis.</p>

<h2 id="children">8. Children</h2>
<p>You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as Genesis is not intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

<h2 id="arbitration">18. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h2>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</p>

<h3>18.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

<h3>18.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
<p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.</p>

<p>Specifically, any dispute that is not resolved under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. The following shall apply in respect of such arbitration:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the number of arbitrators shall be three (one nominated by each party and one nominated by the ICC);</li>
  <li>the decision of the arbitrators will be binding and enforceable against the parties and a judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereto (provided that in no event will the arbitrator have the authority to make any award that provides for punitive or exemplary damages or to award damages excluded by these Terms or in excess of the limitations contained in these Terms);</li>
  <li>the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be the City of Seattle, Washington, USA; and</li>
  <li>the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English, any documents submitted as evidence that are in another language must be accompanied by an English translation and the award will be in the English language.</li>
</ol>

<p>Claimants and respondents shall bear its or their own costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees, and share equally the arbitrators' fees and ICC's administrative costs. For purposes of cost sharing, all claimants shall be considered one party and all respondents shall be considered one party. The parties shall maintain strict confidentiality with respect to all aspects of any arbitration commenced pursuant to these Terms and shall not disclose the fact, conduct or outcome of the arbitration to any non-parties or non-participants, except to the extent required by applicable Law or to the extent necessary to recognize, confirm or enforce the final award or decision in the arbitration, without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration.</p>

<h3>18.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
<p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND THE FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

<h3>18.4 Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Court Claims</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its Intellectual Property Rights. Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>18.5 30-day Right to Opt Out</h3>
<p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: support@genesis.game. Your notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of Genesis, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Foundation also will not be bound by them.</p>

<h3>18.6 Changes to this Section</h3>
<p>The Foundation will provide 60-days' notice of any changes to this section. Changes will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>

<p>These Terms and the relationship between you and the Foundation shall be governed by the laws of the state of Washington, USA, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

<p>For any dispute not subject to arbitration you and The Foundation agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts with seat in the city of Seattle, Washington, USA. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p>

<h2 id="general">19. General Information</h2>
<h3>19.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>These Terms (and any additional terms, rules and conditions of participation that the Foundation may post on Genesis) constitute the entire agreement between you and the Foundation with respect to Genesis and supersedes any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and the Foundation. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the additional terms, rules and conditions of participation, the latter will prevail over the Terms to the extent of the conflict.</p>

<h3>19.2 Waiver and Severability of Terms</h3>
<p>The failure of the Foundation to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>
