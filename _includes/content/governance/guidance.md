<h2>Guidance</h2>
<p>The Game Credits team will shepherd Genesis to the point where the Foundation is fully in place, and the community is ready to take over active development. We expect this will take 12-24 months.</p>
<p>One big area of guidance is providing clear goals for the development community. These goals will encourage groups of community members to come together and work on a piece of the metaverse. Weâ€™ll also hold regular community events such as game jams, hackathons, art jams, and more.</p>
