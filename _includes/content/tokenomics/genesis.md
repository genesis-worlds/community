<h2>GENESIS Tokenomics</h2>
<p><b>GENESIS (erc20)</b>: The GENESIS token is the fundamental building block of the Genesis metaverse. GENESIS is delivered using fair launch principles - it can be mined by holding World tokens, participating in governance, or creating and selling in-game NFTs. There are no special deals, and no tokens set aside for the team, advisors, or anyone else.</p>
<p>The amount of GENESIS emitted is controlled by the number of world tokens owned and the length of time the world tokens are held. There is no end date for the emission of GENESIS, but the emission follows a logarithmic curve, and so emissions reduce naturally over time.</p>
<p>The number of world tokens bought is likewise controlled by the available supply of GAME and the price curve of the worlds - since each world token costs more than the last, this limits the available supply of GENESIS.</p>
<p>GENESIS can also be earned through staking GENESIS in the governance portal. This incentivizes the community to participate in governance, and also to think long-term about the project.</p>
<p>If we assume that 25% of the total amount of GAME (50M GAME) will be locked up into World tokens, the chart below shows that roughly 80 million GENESIS will be emitted over the first 20 years of the project. 40% of this GENESIS is emitted to world token owners, 20% to governance participants, and the remaining 40% to the foundation.</p>

<p>The Foundation will not burn the tokens it owns. But, it will most likely escrow and time-lock those tokens to reduce circulating supply, and ensure it maintains resources for the long term. The mechanics of this time lock will be left up to the Foundation and the community, and may change over time.</p>
