<h3>GENESIS Tokenomics</h3>
<p><b>GENESIS (erc20)</b>: The GENESIS erc20 token is the fundamental building block of the Genesis Multicreator Gaming Universe. GENESIS is delivered using fair launch principles - it can only be mined by holding World Stakes, or earned by participating in governance or liquidity. There are no special deals, and no tokens set aside for the team, advisors, or anyone else.</p>
<p>To mine GENESIS, simply hold one or more World Stakes in your eth address. The longer you hold the World Stakes, the more GENESIS you'll mine. GENESIS mining starts one week after the first world sale.</p>
<p>GENESIS can also be earned through staking GENESIS in the governance portal. This incentivizes the community to participate in governance, and also to think long-term about the project. The earned GENESIS will be split among all governance portal members. Earning through governance starts four weeks after the first world sale.</p>
<p>The amount of GENESIS emitted through mining and governance is limited by the number of World Stakes owned and the length of time the World Stakes are held. There is no end date for the emission of GENESIS, but the emission follows a logarithmic curve, and so emissions reduce naturally over time.</p>
<p>Given the amount of GAME available, the limit on the number of Worlds, and the bonding curves, there's an absolute cap of just over 2Bn GENESIS created over the first 100 years. However, the expected amount is significantly less.</p>

<p>The Foundation will not burn the GENESIS it owns. But, it will most likely escrow and time-lock large portions of that GENESIS to reduce circulating supply, and maintain resources for the long term. The mechanics of this time lock will be left up to the Foundation and the community, and may change over time.</p>
