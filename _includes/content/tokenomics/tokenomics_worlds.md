<h3>World Tokenomics</h3>
<p><b>Mining Claims (ERC-1155)</b>: Mining Claims are bonded NFTs that grant their owners the right to participate in governance for a specific in-game World. We expect a total supply of between 500 and 2000 Mining Claims for each World. Mining Claim owners also mine GENESIS on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>Mining Claims are bought and sold using the existing GAME Credits ERC-20 token. When you buy a Mining Claim, your Game Credits are held in a smart contract, and you receive a Mining Claim NFT. Later, you can redeem GAME Credits by selling the Mining Claim back to the contract at the current market price. Using GAME in this way also puts a hard limit on the number of Mining Claims that can be bought, and therefore also limits the total emissions of GENESIS. This ensures that whales can't come in and skew the supply.</p>
<p>The price of a Mining Claim is determined by a bonding curve that depends on the number of Mining Claims that currently exist for a given world. As the chart below shows, the curve is very shallow, with the first NFT costing 500 GAME, while the 1000th costs 800 and the 2000th costs 2000. The bonding curve also allows you to sell back your Mining Claim based on the number of NFTs that exist, giving you instant liquidity.</p>

<p>To control both the number of claims available, and the maximum supply of GENESIS, the maximum number of claims available increases slowly over time, with 24 available at launch and 1 more available every 30 days.</p>
<p>To reduce the incentive for people to use bots to immediately buy large quantities of Mining Claims at the lowest possible prices, there is a minimum price of 500 GAME set for all Mining Claims. If this proves to be an insufficient disincentive, we also have the ability to set a higher price floor for the first hour of mining claim sales, allowing all users to have fair access.</p>
