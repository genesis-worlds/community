<h3>World Tokenomics</h3>
<p><b>World Shards (ERC-1155)</b>: World Shards are bonded NFTs that grant their owners the right to participate in governance for a specific in-game World. We expect a total supply of between 500 and 2000 World Shards for each World. World Shard owners also mine GENESIS on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>World Shards are bought and sold using the existing GAME Credits ERC-20 token. When you buy a World Shard, your Game Credits are held in a smart contract, and you receive a World Shard NFT. Later, you can redeem GAME Credits by selling the World Shard back to the contract at the current market price. Using GAME in this way also puts a hard limit on the number of World Shards that can be bought, and therefore also limits the total emissions of GENESIS. This ensures that whales can't come in and skew the supply.</p>
<p>The price of a World Shard is determined by a bonding curve that depends on the number of World Shards that currently exist for a given world. As the chart below shows, the curve is very shallow, with the first NFT costing 200 GAME, while the 1000th costs 800 and the 2000th costs 2000. The bonding curve also allows you to sell back your World Shard based on the number of NFTs that exist, giving you instant liquidity.</p>

<p>To control both the number of worlds available, and the maximum supply of GENESIS, the maximum number of worlds available increases slowly over time, with 24 available at launch and 1 more available every 30 days.</p>
<p>To reduce the incentive for people to use bots to immediately buy large quantities of World Shards at the lowest possible prices, the World smart contract sets the minimum price of a World Shard over the first hour of the sale of each World. The minimum price is set at 2000 GAME, so a user who buys in the first second of a World sale pays 2000 GAME, no matter whether 1 or 2000 World Shards have already been sold. Because the minimum price drops over time, it's better to not buy in the first seconds of a World sale, but instead buy some time during the first hour.</p>
