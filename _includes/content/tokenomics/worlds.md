<h2>World Tokenomics</h2>
<p><b>World Stakes (erc1155)</b>: World Stakes are bonded NFTs that grant their owners the right to participate in governance for a specific in-game World. We expect a total supply of between 500 and 2000 stakes for each World. World Stake owners also mine GENESIS on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>World Stakes are bought and sold using the existing GAME Credits erc20 token. When you buy a World Stake, your Game Credits are held in a smart contract, and you receive a World Stake NFT. Later, you can redeem GAME Credits by selling the World Stake back to the contract at the current market price. Using GAME in this way also puts a hard limit on the number of World Shares that can be bought, and therefore also limits the total emissions of GENESIS. This ensures that whales can't come in and skew the supply.</p>
<p>The price of a World Stake is determined by a bonding curve that depends on the number of World Stakes that currently exist for a given world. As the chart below shows, the curve is very shallow, with the first NFT costing 625 GAME, while the 1000th costs 2500 and the 2000th costs 6000. The bonding curve also allows you to sell back your World Stake based on the number of NFTs that exist, giving you instant liquidity.</p>

<p>To control both the number of worlds available, and the maximum supply of GENESIS, the maximum number of worlds available increases slowly over time, with 24 available at launch and 1 more available every 30 days.</p>
