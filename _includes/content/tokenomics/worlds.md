<h3>World Tokenomics</h3>
<p><b>World (erc1155)</b>: World tokens are bonded NFTs that grant their owners the right to participate in governance for a specific in-game World. We expect a total supply of between 500 and 2000 tokens for each World. World token owners also receive GENESIS tokens on an ongoing basis.</p> 
<p>GAME (erc20): The GAME ERC20 token is the foundation of the Game Credits ecosystem, and will be used to kickstart Genesis through buying and selling World tokens, and providing a hard limit on the number of World tokens that can be bought. This is the only utility for GAME in the core Genesis ecosystem; all other parts of the Genesis ecosystem use the GENESIS erc20 token.</p>
<p>The price of a World token is determined by a bonding curve that depends on the number of world tokens that currently exist for a given world. As the chart below shows, the curve is very shallow, with the first token costing 625 GAME, while the 1000th costs 2500 and the 2000th costs 6000. The bonding curve also allows you to sell back your world token based on the number of tokens that exist, giving you instant liquidity for your tokens.</p>

<p>To control both the number of worlds available, and the maximum supply of GENESIS, the maximum number of worlds available increases slowly over time, with 24 available at launch and 1 more available every 30 days.</p>
