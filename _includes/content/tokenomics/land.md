<h3>Land Tokenomics</h3>
<p><b>Land (erc721)</b>: Land tokens are NFTs that allow their owners to build structures and host events. Land tokens are bought in GENESIS, and are available for a fixed timeframe. Half of the GENESIS spent on Land is burned, reducing the supply of GENESIS. The other half is granted to world owners for that world, over a 2-year period. In addition, world owners will receive one Land per world share at the time of the land sale, and the Foundation will own an equivalent amount of land, to be used for community buildings and events.</p>
<p>The Foundation will not receive any GENESIS from the land sale; the land sale contract will burn all but 10% of all GENESIS received in the land sale. The remaining 10% will be distributed to the world-owners for that world.</p>
