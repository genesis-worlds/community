<h2>The Genesis Metaverse</h2>
<p>The Genesis Metaverse is a decentralized galaxy-spanning fantasy MMO, developed and managed by its player community, and played on mobile and desktop devices. Players will travel from world to world, complete player-created quests, fight player-created enemies, and explore player-created environments.</p>
<p>The core goal of the Genesis project is to create a Metaverse that will still be growing, evolving, and actively played in 100 years. To achieve this, development and management of Genesis will be decentralized, with governance decisions guided by the Genesis Foundation, and voted on by players using the GENESIS token. Genesis will run as a nonprofit, with all assets owned by and revenue earned by the Genesis Foundation reinvested in the long-term success of the game.</p>
