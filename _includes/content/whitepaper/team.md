<h2 id="advisors">Advisors</h2>
<p>We’ve received help and advice from many luminaries of the crypto, defi, metaverse worlds. We credit them here because it’s important to recognize individuals and teams for the help they’ve given us in getting to where we are. None of these people have received or are entitled to any GENESIS tokens, and we do not ever intend to provide GENESIS tokens to advisors. Further, inclusion on this list should not imply that the named individual endorses Genesis Worlds or the GENESIS token.</p>

<h2 id="investors">Investors</h2>
<p>This page is intentionally left blank... </p>
<p>...because we have no investors. Investors think short term, and put profits above commnuity. With no external investors, we can focus on the long term, and are accountable to the community and only to the community.</p>
