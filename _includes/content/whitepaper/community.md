<p>The Genesis community is made up of a vast range of creators, makers, developers, and more. Everyone has their own experience and skills, and we all work together to deliver a game that’s out of this world.</p>
<p>To grow the community, we’ll encourage forming and running small groups, provide them with tools, resources, and communication channels.</p>
<p>Community groups inside Genesis could include game dev students, groups of friends, indie developers, artist collectives, or even complete strangers (the internet is a wonderful place).</p>
<h3>Community Sites</h3>
<p>A great place to get more involved in the Genesis community is to join the discussions on one of our community sites:</p>
