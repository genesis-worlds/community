<p>Community Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Genesis platform, including core protocol specifications, APIs, and contract standards.</p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>First review <a href="{{"cips/cip-1"|relative_url}}">CIP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and add your CIP to it. There is a <a href="https://github.com/genesis-worlds/governance/blob/main/cip-template.md">template CIP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to Genesis's <a href="https://github.com/genesis-worlds/community">CIPs repository</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cip_status">CIP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - a CIP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - a CIP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Accepted</strong> - a core CIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide when and how to encode a CIP into the software is not part of the CIP process. If such a decision is made, the CIP will move to final. </li>
  <li><strong>Final</strong> - a CIP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.</li>

<h2 id="cip_types">CIP Types</h2>

<p>Community Improvement Proposals describe any change that affects most or all Genesis implementations, such as a change to the the community guidelines, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Genesis. Furthermore CIPs can be broken down into the following four categories.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"cips/core"|relative_url}}">Core</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Core"|size}})</h3>
<p>Improvements to the core community documents, requiring changes to a core community document, or adding a new core community document. The core commnuity documents can be found here: FIXME.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"cips/governance"|relative_url}}">Governance</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Governance"|size}})</h3>
<p>Includes improvements around governance for Genesis, including governance contracts, community organization, and foundation. They may propose an implementation, but not to Genesis's codebase; they often require community consensus; hey are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Genesis development.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"cips/standards"|relative_url}}">Standards</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards"|size}})</h3>
<p>Includes platform-level and application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards for in-game items, software development standards, URI schemes, API standards, etc.</p>

<h3><a href="{{"cips/gamedev"|relative_url}}">GameDev</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","GameDev"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes a Genesis game design or development issue, across game mechanics, lore, art, economy, software, etc.</p>
